## 1\.  Least Privilege Model 

The configurations demonstrate a robust, security-conscious approach that is critical for production environments.

  * **Zero-Trust Networking**: The most significant practice is the use of `NetworkPolicy`. By starting with a `default-deny-all` rule, a **zero-trust** foundation is established. This ensures that no pod can communicate with any other pod unless there is an explicit rule allowing it, dramatically reducing the potential attack surface.
  * **Explicit Communication Rules**: For each service (`frontend`, `cart-service`, etc.), granular `ingress` (incoming) and `egress` (outgoing) rules are defined. This creates a precise communication graph, ensuring services can *only* talk to the other services they're supposed to.
  * **Secure Egress to the Internet**: The `query-service-policy` is particularly advanced. It allows the pod to communicate with external APIs (like AWS Bedrock) by permitting egress to `0.0.0.0/0`, but it wisely **excludes** private IP ranges. This prevents a compromised container from using its external access to scan the internal cloud network.
  * **Principle of Least Privilege (RBAC)**: For the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), a specific `ClusterRole` (`hpa-metrics-reader`) was created that only grants the permissions needed to read metrics (`get`, `list`, `watch`). Broad `cluster-admin` rights were not used, perfectly following the **principle of least privilege**.
  * **Running as a Non-Root User**: In the `cart-service-deployment`, the `securityContext` is set to run the application as a non-root user (`runAsUser: 1000`). This is a critical security measure that limits potential damage if the application process is exploited.
  * **Secure Secrets Management**: Credentials for AWS are injected from a Kubernetes `Secret` (`aws-credentials`) rather than being hardcoded in the deployment manifest or Docker image. This is the standard, secure way to handle sensitive data.
  * **Scoped Privilege with Init Containers**: To solve potential volume permission issues when running as non-root, an **initContainer** is used. It runs as root (`runAsUser: 0`) for the *sole purpose* of running `chown` to fix permissions before the main application container starts. This is an advanced and highly effective pattern.

## 2\. High Availability and Resilience 

The system is designed to handle failures and scale with demand, ensuring the application remains available and performant.

  * **Automated Scaling (HPA)**: The `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` for the `frontend-deployment` automatically scales the number of replicas based on both **CPU and memory utilization**. Setting `minReplicas: 2` also ensures that there are at least two instances running, avoiding a single point of failure.
  * **Guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS)**: By setting both `requests` and `limits` for CPU and memory, the pods are given a **Guaranteed QoS class**. This tells the Kubernetes scheduler exactly what resources the application needs, leading to more stable and predictable performance.
  * **Robust Health Checks for Slow Starters**: The `query-service` uses a `startupProbe`. This is a fantastic choice for applications that may take a long time to start, as it prevents the pod from being killed prematurely during a slow startup.

## 3\. Effective Configuration and State Management 

The manifests show a clear separation of concerns, making the application easier to manage, configure, and maintain.

  * **Decoupled Configuration**: A `ConfigMap` (`ecommerce-config`) is used to store environment-specific variables. Injecting this into deployments with `envFrom` means configuration can be changed without rebuilding Docker images, a core principle of cloud-native development.
  * **Decoupled Storage**: For the stateful `cart-service`, the storage definition (`PersistentVolume`) is correctly separated from the application's request for storage (`PersistentVolumeClaim`). This abstraction allows the underlying storage to be changed without modifying the application's deployment manifests.

-----

## 4\. Intelligent Traffic Routing 

External user traffic is effectively managed to access the various microservices.

  * **Centralized Ingress**: An `Ingress` resource acts as a single entry point for the entire application, which is much cleaner and more efficient than exposing each service with its own LoadBalancer.
  * **Path-Based Routing**: The Ingress rules intelligently route traffic to the correct backend service based on the request path (e.g., `/cart` goes to the cart service).
  * **Correct Rule Ordering**: Crucially, the most specific paths (`/query`, `/products`) are placed before the general catch-all path (`/`). This ensures that specific requests are routed correctly before the catch-all takes over for the frontend UI.
